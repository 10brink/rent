Tighten geo scope. Use center + radius (if the API supports it) or filter by lat/lon after fetch to keep comparables within the market boundary.

Feature enrichments (when data available): property age, amenities flags, price per sqft, distance to downtown/major employer/university, and listing recency.


Add inline validation with friendly hints (e.g., “sqft looks low for 2 beds”).
Add a saved “last prediction” strip at the top so users can compare runs.
Improve the comps list with tiny badges (beds/baths/sqft) and highlight the closest comp.
